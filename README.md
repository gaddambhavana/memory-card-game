## Project Description
The Memory Card Game is a classic memory-testing game where players need to match pairs of cards. This web-based game helps improve your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while providing an enjoyable experience. The objective is to find all matching pairs by clicking on the cards, which initially show a face-down view. The game tracks the number of moves taken and the time spent until all pairs are matched.

### Game Features
- **Game Structure**: A grid of facedown cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6).
- **Matching Logic**: Cards can be flipped to reveal their images, and matches remain face-up while non-matching pairs flip back down.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the number of moves and time taken during the game.
- **New Game Option**: A button to start a new game that shuffles the cards.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Usage
Click on a card to flip it and reveal the image.
Try to find matching pairs by clicking on two cards. If they match, they will stay face up; if not, they will turn back down after a brief delay.
Keep track of the number of moves and the time taken displayed on the screen.
Use the "New Game" button to reset the game and shuffle the cards for a new round.
